#Alright, so in the last lesson we worked on defining and modifying variables in the shell

#So, for example, we can define the variable: 
santa=HOHOHO Merry Christmas

#Do you recall how to call back the variable we just defined? 
echo $santa

#We also learned a few tricks to modify variables in the shell using regular expressions

elf=${santa#HOHOHO}

#Replace all the characters
elf=${santa//HO/HE}
